# FAIR_Simulation

We are a group of six students doing an ADP at the FST of the TU Darmstadt.
Our topic is the 'Development of a simulation environment for the application of multi-agents to control fluid systems efficiently and resiliently' aka Project_460.
The background of this topic arises from the high energy consumption for the transport of fluids.
For a minimal example of a multi-story house, a framework and building blocks for the simulation of the fluid system in combination with multi-agent systems were developed.
The code covers a large part of the workflow from the input of external data sheets, modeling of the MAS, communication between the MAS and the fluid system to the evaluation of the data.
The whole project has been designed under the FAIR principle.
