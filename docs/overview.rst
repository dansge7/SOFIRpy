Overview
========

Tools like OpenModelica and Dymola are excellent tools for modelling complex physical systems.
In recent years, new approaches to control these systems have emerged. Particular
focus has been placed on control systems that are based on machine learning algorithm's. 
Thereby Python offers extensive tools for the development of these control systems, so it is
of interest to couple these physical models with controllers written in Python. 

fair_sim is a Python package that provides functionalities to couple models build
in OpenModelica or Dymola with controllers written in Python.
