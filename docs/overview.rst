Overview
========

Tools like OpenModelica and Dymola are excellent tools to model complex physical systems.
In recent years, new approaches to control these complex systems have emerged. Particular
focus has been placed on control systems that are based on machine learning algorithm's. 
Thereby Python offers extensive tools for the development of these systems, so it is
of interest to couple these physical models with programs written in Python. 
This package provides easy to use functionalities to couple these physical models with controllers
written in python.
